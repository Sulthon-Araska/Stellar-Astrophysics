# Stellar Astrophysics
Python programming for modeling stellar structure and visualizing astrophysical effects inside a star.

During the 5th semester of undergraduate Astronomical studies at Bandung Institute of Technology, two compulsory physics-rich courses: _Astrophysical Process_ and _Stellar Phyiscs_ have quite overlapping syllabi of materials and, of course, intercorrelating with each other. Subjects span from **black-body radiation**, **radiation field**, **radiative transfer**, **atmospheric absorption**, and **interior stellar structure & evolution**.
